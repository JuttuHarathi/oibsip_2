    <p id="head">Biography:</p>
    <p>
        Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin in Kentucky on 
        February 12, 1809, to parents who could neither read nor 
        write. He went to school on and off for a total of about a 
        year, but he educated himself by reading borrowed books. 
        When Lincoln was nine years old, his mother died. His 
        father—a carpenter and farmer—remarried and moved his family 
        farther west, eventually settling in Illinois.
        As a young adult, Lincoln worked as a flatboat navigator, 
        storekeeper, soldier, surveyor, and postmaster. At age 25 
        he was elected to the local government in Springfield, 
        Illinois. Once there, he taught himself law, opened a law 
        practice, and earned the nickname "Honest Abe".

    <p id="head">Other Accomplishments:</p>
    <p>
        He established the Department of Agriculture; 
        supported the development of a transcontinental railroad; enacted 
        the Homestead Act, which opened up land to settlers; and crafted 
        the 13th Amendment, which ended the enslavement of people.

        Lincoln's presidency was tragically cut short, but his 
        contributions to the United States ensured that he would be 
        remembered as one of its most influential presidents.
